# Data Mesh in Practice (Open Source Book)

## Introduction

This is my first *Open Source Book* - a collaborative effort to come up with a book explaining how Zhamak Dehghani's *Data Mesh* can be put to use - both organizationally and technically. While Zhamak is going to release her book titled *Data Mesh* with O'Reilly at the end of this year, our aim is to finish a first edition of ours only shortly after to augment Zhamak's book with *a more practically-oriented companion*.

For us, *Practically* means both *technically*, i.e., how Zhamak's Data Mesh principles can be implemented with software, but even more so, *organizationally*. We think that Data Mesh has so far often been slightly misunderstood as a more technical, architectural concept just confined to the analytics space, but for us, the *organizational consequences* advocated by Zhamak also *beyond the analytics space* are even more important and powerful.

We see Data Mesh as a continuation of the fundamental business concept described originally by Alfred P. Sloan in his 1964 Doubleday book *My Time With General Motors*, where he wrote:

> It has been a thesis of this book that good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization, or *decentralization with co-ordinated control*.

In the software world, the same idea has been taken up numerous times, most notably in Eric Evan's 2003 book *Domain-Driven Design* and Sam Newman's 2015 book *Building Microservices*, but until Zhamak's Data Mesh, the software and the business world have stayed disconnected for the most part. Their intersection and the need for a coordinated decentralization in both worlds has rarely been discussed and taken up, and we think that Data Mesh provides a big opportunity to *re-connect the software with the business world*.

## Format

We have decided to use Markdown as our markup language for writing the book for simplicity and to make the entrance barrier for new writers as low as possible.
