# The Data Mesh Gitbook initiative

2021 has generated a lot of hype about the data mesh. Although, Zhamak's original thesis on this topic appeared first in 2019, the theme is still fuzzy in many people's heads. This is maily because the original idea is more descriptively theoretical in nature and stops short of a practical view. From our perspective, we find the idea powerful but needing to be supplemented with prescriptive approaches focused on a light weight implementation framework enterprises can use, if not adopting it at scale. There have been a few implementations out in the wild, which we will attempt to cover as case studies, including those in our experience. However, we're cognizant that these are still evolving and that our thoughts must be revised within the reality of what can actually be adopted into production by an aspirational organization.

We shall cover broadly the following topics at some level of detail, explored incrementally.

- The state of data architecture

Focusing on how data organizations remain the last bastions of fully monolithic, hypeerspcialized silos. We will talk about the obvious shortcomings of these models in the face of evolving needs of today. We will evaluate emergent data architecture blueprints and attempt to harmonize this with the notion of the data mesh.

- Breaking the data monolith

Data monoliths today are bigger than ever. Breaking it is less (or more) trivial than it seems, depending on how you look at it. We will attempt to apply principles of domain driven systems design, microservices & cloud native architectures to provide a contrast as well as distilled patterns on how to modernize your data landscape, incrementally.

- Dissecting the data organization

It is a well known fact that teams produce technical architectures that model their own org structure. We will attempt to address how this is a fundamental reorientation that is needed to make your organization more data driven. We will also touch upon the aspects of domain driven data ownership, autonomy and decentralization, but with governance.

- The data mesh & infrastructure underpinnings

The data mesh is infact a technology solution and is built on a foundation of enterprise-grade tooling. This involves, but is not limited to event/data brokers, storage, stream processing, networking & the general gamut of integration & cloud native tooling. We will attempt to disambiguate what a data mesh in flesh and blood would look like, when deployed across an enterprise.

- Adoption & maturity model

The data mesh is finally not a silver bullet to solving anything. We genuinely believe that there is value in it as an operating model as exemplified by early adopters & piooners; In this chapter, we will look at how you can evolve a realistic roadmap to adopt & mature. We
