The new working title is: "Curing the Digital Disorganization - With Data Mesh, Microservices, and Kafka".
 
In this first outline, I envisage it to have three parts:
I The Digital Disorganization
II Data Mesh, Microservices, and Kafka
III Curing the Digital Disrganization
 
...and these are the individual chapter making up the first part ("The Digital Disorganization"):
* Chapter 1: Digital Transformation - A Broken Promise?
  This chapter will be about why the words "Digital Transformation", in many corporations, often stay what they are: just words. Many, especially larger established corporations, and even governments, talk about "Digital Transformation", but they have no idea whatsoever how to make it happen.
* Chapter 2: Business Organization and Digital Organization - The Great Divide
  This chapter will be about one of the largest problems that corporations have with making the Digital Transformation happen: The huge discrepancy between business organization (de-centralized) and digital organization (centralized), especially, but not only when it comes to data and analytics.
* Chapter 3: Digital Transformation - Fulfilling the Promise
  This chapter gives, in high-level terms, an outlook on how the promise of the Digital Transformation could be fulfilled: by closely aligning the digital organization to the business organization. It also already hints at how this close alignment of the business domains with the digital domains could be achieved in practice: by combining the ideas of Data Mesh (for the digital organization), Microservices (for the architecture), and Kafka (for the implementation).

These are the envisaged individual chapters of the second part ("Data Mesh, Microservices and Kafka"):
* Chapter 4: What are Microservices?
  This is about the idea of Microservices, its origins also in Domain-Driven Design, and how they have already revolutionized the architecture of software systems.
* Chapter 5: What is Data Mesh?
  This is about Zhamaks ideas for Data Mesh, rooted, for a large part, in both Domain-Driven Design and Microservices - and how Data Mesh is set to revolutionize not only the architecture of software systems nor analytics, but much more important than that, the digital organization of entire corporations.
* Chapter 6: What is Kafka?
  This is about event streaming and Kafka in particular, its origins, its present, and the future, and first glimpses on its role as an industry standard for building Microservices, and probably also a possible key base technology to implement the principles of Data Mesh.

...and here are the envisaged chapters for the third and final part ("The Digital Organization"):
* Chapter 7: Microservices for the Architecture
  This is about why and how the architecture of software systems should be based on the concepts of Microservices.
* Chapter 8: Data Mesh for the Digital (Re-)Organization
  Why and how the principles behind Data Mesh should shape the digital (re-)organization.
* Chapter 9: Kafka for the Implementation
  This is about why and how Kafka is not only just a key ingredient in implementing the architecture of software systems along the lines of Microservices. In this chapter, we show how Kafka-based technologies can already, at the same time, also serve as the fundamental technology for the implementation of the Data Mesh and therefore also already serve as the first fundamental technology of its kind to cure the digital disorganization.
