## Chapters

### Part I - Business Organization and Digital Organization - the Great Divide

1) Business Organization is Already Decentralized - The business organization is often already as decentralized as possible, building on ideas first elucidated by Alfred P. Sloan in his 1964 book *My Years with General Motors*.

2) Digital Organization is Still Centralized around Technology - The digital organization is almost always still centralized and built around the boundaries of technology like, in the analytics space, data warehouses/data lakes/lakehouses etc.

3) The Great Divide and the Consequences - The great divide between business and digital organization leads to a number of negative consequences, and eventually to a lot of money spent on failing projects.

### Part II - The Principles of Data Mesh

1) A History of Data Mesh - This is about the history of Data Mesh, influenced e.g. by Eric Evan's 2003 book *Domain-Driven Design* and Sam Newman's 2015 book *Building Microservices*.

2) Principle 1: Domain-oriented Ownership

3) Principle 2: Data as a Product

4) Principle 3: Self-serve Data Platform

5) Principle 4: Federated Computational Governance

### Part III - Business Implementation of Data Mesh

1) Decentralize

2) Co-ordinate the Decentralization

3) Success Stories

### Part IV - Technical Implementation of Data Mesh

1) Decentralize and Adopt Microservices

2) Co-ordinate the Decentralization

3) Concrete Technical Implementations - Here, e.g. the implementation described by Marc Schultze and Arif Wider at Spark & AI Summit 2020 (see [reading list](reading.md)) using an infrastructure based on S3 could come in handy. Another approach is the one described by Ben Stopford and Michael Noll at Kafka Summit Europe 2021 (see [reading list](reading.md)) using a Kafka-based infrastructure.
